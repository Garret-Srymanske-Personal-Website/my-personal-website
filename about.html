                <p>One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is to take an adventure along one of the many trails that the Phoenix area has to offer. When I was a kid, my mom was always taking me camping and this grew a love for the outdoors. This passion only grew more as I became a teenager and signed up for my local Boy Scout troop. Our troop did an annual hike along a section of the Appalachain trail every year during November for about four or five days during a teacher convention when everyone was off from school. Moving to Arizona has reawakened this passion for the outdoors, especially now with all the new wildlife that can be encountered in the desert that will never be natural to my home state of New Jersey.</p>

                <p>There's nothing I love more than sports. Whether watching or playing, I can do them all day every day. My favorite sport to play is basketball, but there is <strong>nothing</strong> like attending an Eagles home game! I grew up playing just about everything at some point in time but basketball stole the show when it mattered most in high school. My goal was to be able to dunk my the end of my senior year, but a couple bad knees never let me get quite high enough.</p>
