# Welcome to my personal website! 

Here you will find basic information about me and some of the projets I've worked on or completed as a software developer. Feel free to drop in and get to know me a little!

Within this repository you will find seven different files: three are HTML, two are CSS, and the final one is a simple JS file. Each HTML file links to a different page contained within my website and each has been labeled to indicate which page they load for. Of the two CSS files, one holds the stylings for my website as a whole, while the other contains stylings specific to just the landing page, or my index.html file. 

Upon opening this website you will be greeted with a message welcoming you to my website that's incorporated using the JS file I have added to the landing page. All of my photos, except for the calculator project image, have a link to an external site associated with the image or section it belongs to. For example, I have linked my pup's instagram account to his picture on my landing page. 

Feel free to add me on LinkedIn, which you can find a link to at the bottom of each page along with a link to my personal GitHub profile.

Thank you for checking out my site and I hope you got to know me better and enjoy my projects!
